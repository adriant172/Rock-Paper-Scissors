# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is a simple web-based game of rock-paper-scissors with a basic vanilla CSS UI!

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to make use of the newly learned knowledge of DOM maniuplation using javascript. I have also applied some basis CSS alignement to make the UI a bit easier on the eyes. 

## Discovery
I realized that the way I originally structured my code for the first version of this project didn't entirely work with the new UI based version. Due to this I had to do quite a bit of refactoring my code in order to get things working. This provided some good practice of the real-world scenario of refactoring your code in order to fit rapidly changng code bases.
